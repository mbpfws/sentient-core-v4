I Think you can enhance the flow robustness by amplifying the prompting and more detail instruction making use of ground and chain of searching techniques searching for latest 2025 tech and enhance the intelligence of the agent node where it needs with model like "gemini-2.5-pro" - making more sub-graphs and nested to handle more detailed generation - and also having agent to generate outline of what it intends to generation first -> asking for human feedback loop before actual generation -> 
- for the subsequent node or node of relational documents -> have an ingest generation node in-between to have LLM generate synthesized knowledge -> parse that synthesized knowledge into the prompt sent to the next node before generation of the outline of list of task for the particular document generation -> ask for human feedback loop -> so he can input what need to change or simply approve for generation
- Another improvement is the local document storage and management system -> make it into project, more hierarchical and stored in visualized nodes (mind-mapping style - of which when user click into -> display the document in full -> and supported with persistent chat session right at the document when user want to learn more about that particular aspect of the document and the relational related nodes - making use of huge context of gemini-2.5-flash to include the parents and siblings documents) -> hierarchical manner also shows the documents in toggle summary tabs of metadata -> the management is amplified with searching, filtering, sort features
- Can you make the API to be used with client key stored in their local storage because I am going to publish this app to the public free of charge and let them use their own gemini API key
- I want this to be more robust with front end designer and architectural visualizer nodes - by developing with React NodeJS are there any library that can be used with agentic framework that LLMs can output very decent, professionally made svg mockup of all interfaces and pages (Replit has been doing it very nicely and look realistic this is done by them generation of the static preview before actual app development and I wonder what technology they use )
- For the architecture visualizer I am thinking of using E2B https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook/tree/main/examples/agentkit-coding-agent - to have python code drawing these (exactly like how Perplexity is doing for Lab and output in png format) or use Mermaid for some cases:
	- Project structure
	- API layers designs and their operation
	- database and data table - relationships - triggers
	- and other graphs that you may recommend essential for development of a full-stack
