Initial version

A sophisticated multi-agent RAG system prototype for autonomous documentation generation with hierarchical management, real-time streaming, and human-in-the-loop validation

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Implement LangGraph-based workflow with 3-5 specialized agents (Document Analyzer, Content Generator, Validation Agent, Human Feedback Coordinator)

**Hierarchical Document Management**: Create, organize, edit, and manage project documents in a structured hierarchy with sorting, filtering, and search capabilities

**AI-Optimized Document Generation**: Generate comprehensive project documentation including executive summaries, technical specifications, API designs, and architecture diagrams

**Real-time Streaming**: Stream agent actions and reasoning steps to the client interface with persistent storage

**Groq Integration**: Leverage Groq's Compound Beta API for enhanced search, code generation, and debugging capabilities

**Export Capabilities**: Export documents to Markdown and JSON formats

**Persistent Storage**: Store documents in both client-side localStorage and PostgreSQL database

**Human-in-the-Loop**: Implement validation checkpoints where human review and approval are required before proceeding
