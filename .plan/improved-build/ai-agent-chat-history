Base on this running codebase that I have built on a phase 1 of autonomous app development - called project documents generation and management - This multi agents nodes and flow demonstrate this 

- @D:\Git\sentient-core-v4\.plan\initial-plan\Project Proposal Autonomous Full-Stack Application Development System.md with 

- With this as iteration on how the flow should be @D:\Git\sentient-core-v4\.plan\initial-plan\Phase 1 Workflows Intelligent Orchestrator Demonstration & Robustness Validation for Automated Project Definition.md

- and this detail is the task breakdown @D:\Git\sentient-core-v4\.plan\initial-plan\DOCUMENT FLOW TASK BREAK DOWN.md

- This is the sets of documents that is expected to be managed once the completion of the graph-based flow @D:\Git\sentient-core-v4\.plan\initial-plan\Documents generation expectation.md  

- This is all client-side local management with a very robust project management archive explorer and storage

- Now that I want to amplify these features: 

- More graphs and nodes to amplify the completeness and fineness of the documents set allowing Agentic AI development
- Integration of the 2 new nodes called 
1. Front-end mock up interfaces
2. Architectural visulizer
